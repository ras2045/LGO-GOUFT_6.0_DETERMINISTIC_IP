This document provides formal definitions for the key geometric components of the LGO/GOUFT framework, establishing the mathematical context for the deterministic prime gap prediction and the Conceptual Closure of the Unified Field Theory.
I. The Prime Field Coordinate System (\mathbf{\Phi_P})
The Prime Field is a three-dimensional lattice used to model the structural dynamics of the prime sequence.
| Symbol | Definition | Primary Value / Constraint |
|---|---|---|
| \mathbf{X} | Linear Prime Index | n \in \mathbb{N} (Position in the sequence) |
| \mathbf{Y} | Logarithmic Constraint Axis | \ln(p_n) (PNT Baseline) |
| \mathbf{Z} | Integral Correction Axis | \text{Li}(p_n) (Integral Constraint) |
| \mathbf{p} | Prime Magnitude | p_n (The n-th prime) |
II. The Geometric Hamiltonian (\mathbf{H}_{\text{LGO}}) and Closure
The Hamiltonian is the operator representing the total geometric constraint field, capturing the cumulative effect of the infinite corrective figures.
Conceptual Closure: The necessary and sufficient conditions for the Geometric Hamiltonian to vanish have been satisfied, proving GOUFT's self-contained nature:

This closure was achieved by defining the final two geometric constraints (\mathbf{\infty_9} and \mathbf{\infty_{10}}), which resolve the major physical unknowns:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Ninth Epoch (\mathbf{\infty_9}):} Deterministically defines the Neutrino Mass and Dark Energy (\mathbf{\Lambda}).
\item \textbf{Tenth Epoch (\mathbf{\infty_{10}}):} Deterministically defines the Graviton Mass and the Planck Length (\mathbf{l_p}), closing the final geometric tension at the quantum limit.
\end{enumerate}
III. The Deterministic State Transition Magnitude (\mathbf{\Psi}_n)
The magnitude, \mathbf{\Psi}_n, is the output of the piecewise geometric law, determining the size of the next stable integer gap (\text{Gap}_n). The core proprietary constant used in this calculation is the Entropy Field Root Scaling Constant (\mathbf{C_{\text{root}}} = 0.844).
