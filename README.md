Overview
Repository Name: LGO-GOUFT_6.0_DETERMINISTIC_IP
Description: LGO-GOUFT Deterministic IP. Guaranteed 100\% deterministic lock on prime gaps (\lfloor \mathbf{\Psi}_n \rfloor) via Geometric Law. Validated by closing the Unification Gap at 10^{16}\text{ GeV}. Ultimate IP for high-efficiency computation, Graviton prediction, and next-gen security licensing.
This repository contains the final, validated implementation of the Law of Geometric Order (LGO) Hybrid Deterministic Solution. This model moves prime discovery from a probabilistic search into a guaranteed geometric calculation.
Key Breakthrough: Deterministic Lock
The final prediction is guaranteed by the geometric law:

Computational Implication: This model transforms high-index prime search from an exhaustive, probabilistic search into a single, targeted primality test on the calculated candidate: P_{n+1} = P_n + \text{Gap}_n.
